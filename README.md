# Smooth Stone Extensions

Adds Smooth Stone Stairs and Walls. Craftable from the crafting table and the stonecutter as usual.

Custom Stair and Wall models so that they have the darkened edges of the smooth stone. Works fine with resource packs that follow vanilla's texture proportions. You're free to use these in your own projects!
